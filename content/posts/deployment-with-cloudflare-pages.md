[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) was recently just released in public beta and I'm very happy to give it my first try. In this tutorial, we'll walk through a step-by-step process of deploying a Nuxt.js application using Cloudflare Pages.

# What is Cloudflare Pages?

[Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) is a platform for deploying your frontend application. Pages are super-fast, always up-to-date, and deployed directly from your GitHub account.
