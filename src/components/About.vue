      Gift Egwuenu is a front-end developer passionate about making the web
      accessible to everyone and advocating building open and inclusive
      developer communities. She loves sharing her knowledge and does that
      through content creation on her blog and YouTube channel. She's a Media
      Developer Expert at Cloudinary, Microsoft MVP, an Auth0 Ambassador, GitHub Star, and a Nuxt.js
      Ambassador. When she's not coding, you can find me geeking about
      photography, trying new food recipes, and exploring different ways of
      creating content that can help people pivot their tech careers.
