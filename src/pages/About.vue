					Hi, I'm Gift Egwuenu - a frontend developer and content creator originally
					from Delta, Nigeria but based in Haarlem Netherlands.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-8">
					I have worked in tech and on the web for the past 4 years with experience
					ranging from Javascript, Vue.js, CSS, Accessibility, Technical Writing and
					I have worked for companies like Rekuur Solutions, Andela, Ruby Together
					and Passionate People.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-8">
					I love sharing and contributing to the tech community but it's a big part
					of my career in tech and I'm consistently engaging and advocating for open
					and inclusive developer communities.I love sharing my knowledge and do that
					through content creation on my blog and YouTube channel. I've been
					nominated as a Media Developer Expert at Cloudinary, Microsoft MVP, an
					Auth0 Ambassador, GitHub Star, and a Nuxt.js Ambassador.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-8">
					When I'm not coding, you can find me geeking about photography, trying new
					food recipes, and exploring different ways of creating content that can
					help people pivot their tech careers.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-8">
					I share a lot of helpful resources for developers and also curate some
					resources myself. You can check out Educative a platform with helpful
